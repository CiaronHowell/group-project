# group-project
This is the COMP208 group project. 

Our group consists of myself, [Kian Hogg](https://github.com/Kian-Hogg), [Ben Darian](https://github.com/BFDarian), [Zizi Banda](https://github.com/johnZbanda), [Huba Benzar](https://github.com/hubabenzar) and [Charlie Foster](https://github.com/Topfoz).

# group-idea
We are planning on creating a recipe app that will allow the user to input ingredients into their inventory and then search recipes from a database given the ingredients they possess. 

# languages
For the frontend and backend we are going to use NodeJS with several packages such as express & mysql.


Remember to do 'npm install' with backend and frontend folders
